    "The `numpy` function library is required for numeric calculations. It allows us to do mathematics using transcendental quantities such as $\\pi$ and $e$, and it introduces mathematical functions such as $\\sin$ and $\\cos$. In the preamble below we import the library using a convenient short name `np`. Therefore to use the definitions from this library we have to type `np.def` where `def` is the definition or function that we want to use. Crucially, the `numpy` library also allows us to create and work with arrays, whilst other mathematical libraries in Python do not have this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib.pyplot` library is used to make plots of our results. In the preamble below we import the library using a convenient short name `plt`. It allows us to create a variety of figures, including `plot`, `quiver`, and `streamplot` types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scipy` library is a very powerful suite of scientific methods. We will only use one function from this vast library, and so we import it with its own name. The `odeint` function is used to solve ordinary differential equations."
